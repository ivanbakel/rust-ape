@title Using a code block operator twice

@code_type rust .rs

The code block operator can only be used once per pattern - any more is considered more likely to be a user error than deliberate, and causes a message to be raised.

This ignores bracketing, as it should not be syntactically significant apart from for precedence purposes.
