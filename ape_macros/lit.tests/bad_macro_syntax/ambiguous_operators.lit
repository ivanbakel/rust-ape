@title Ambiguous operator combination

@code_type rust .rs

The operators `**`, `++`, `*`, and `+` all have the same precedence - it is not clear how they would be expected to be combined by the user, and to avoid unexpected behaviour, they have to be disambiguated via bracketing when used together.
--- ambiguous_operators.rs
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]
extern crate ape;

use ape::arb_peg;

struct Foo {}
struct Bar {}

fn main() {
  arb_peg!{ Foo ** Bar+ }
}
---

The expected error mentions the two operators used and the ambiguity between them.

--- ambiguous_operators.stderr
