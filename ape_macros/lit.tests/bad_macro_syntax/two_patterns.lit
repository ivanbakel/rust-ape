@title Two patterns with no separation

@code_type rust .rs

A pattern should never be immediately followed by another pattern - though we could interpret this as sequencing, we don't, yet.
--- two_patterns.rs
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]
extern crate ape_macros;

use ape_macros::pattern;

struct Foo {}

fn main() {
  pattern!{ Foo Foo }
}
---

The expected error is that the second pattern is not expected after the first.

--- two_patterns.stderr
error: Encountered an unexpected `Foo`
 --> $DIR/two_patterns.rs:9:17

9 |   pattern!{ Foo Foo }
  |                 ^^^

error: aborting due to previous error
